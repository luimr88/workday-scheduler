# Work Day Scheduler

## Webpage Functionality
* The user is presented with a daily planner that has time blocks for standard business hours(8am and 5pm).
* The user can enter a task into the time blocks and click the save button to save their task.
* When the user refreshes the page all tasks entered will still appear since events are saved in local storage.
* Time blocks are color coded depending on the current time of the day. Grey for past time blocks, red for the time block that matches the current time, and green for future time blocks.
